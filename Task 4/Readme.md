# Assignment 4: Subject Allotment System

This project demonstrates a stored procedure that automates the allocation of subjects to students based on their preferences and GPA, as part of an internship SQL assignment.

---

## ✅ Objective

To assign students to one of their preferred subjects following the rules:

- Each student selects *5 subjects* in order of preference.
- Each subject has *limited seats*.
- Students are allotted based on *highest GPA first*.
- A student receives the *first available subject* from their preferences.
- If none of the 5 subjects are available, the student is marked *unallotted*.

## 🧱 Database Tables

**1. StudentDetails**  
Contains student info and GPA.

**2. SubjectDetails**  
Subject names and seat availability.

**3. StudentPreference**  
Stores 5 preferences per student.

**4. Allotments**  
Output: student and subject mapping.

**5. UnallotedStudents**  
Output: list of students who didn’t get any preferred subject.
